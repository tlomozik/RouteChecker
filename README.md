# RouteChecker
The purpose of this mobile application is to identify surface irregularities on roads. The main component is an Android application that uses an algorithm to register irregularities by collecting data from the device's built-in accelerometer. The application was developed using the JavaScript programming language and the React Native library. The Firebase hosting service and Firebase Database service were utilized for real-time data storage and retrieval. By providing a convenient and cost-effective way to monitor road conditions, this application has the potential to improve road safety and reduce vehicle maintenance costs.
